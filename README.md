### BASIC COMPUTER TERMS

#### Computer
A computer is a device that executes a program or programs. 

#### Hardware:
Hardware consists of the physical components of your computer. If you can kick it, punch it, or pick it up to throw it, it’s hardware. For e.g. Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor are hardware

#### Software	
A software is a program application; which provides the computer with step-by-step instructions to perform a specific task. A computer cannot function without software.

#### Application Program
A Program that has been created to perform a specific task that is useful to the user. Examples include Word Processors (Word), Spreadsheets (Excel), Browsers (Netscape) and Drawing Packages (Paint).

#### CPU 
The central processing unit or CPU, also known as the microprocessor or processor. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions

#### Operating System  
The operating system (OS) of a computer is the software that communicates with the computer hardware. No software can run on the computer without the operating system.

#### File 
A file is a block of information that includes word documents, pictures, music, etc. Each file is differentiated with the help of a unique file name. 

#### Folder 
A folder is a system that helps in organizing files, programs and projects on the computer. It is similar to organizing files on a shelf in your cabinet. 

#### Memory	
Chips that hold information that the computer needs to use. These chips are connected directly to the Microprocessor. There are two types of Memory Chip: Random Access Memory (RAM) and Read Only Media (ROM)

##### RAM
> RAM (random access memory) is the memory of a computer which works actively with the hard drive. It pulls the data when it’s in use then returns it back to the hard drive once you’re done with it.

##### ROM
> ROM is a storage medium that is used with computers and other electronic devices. As the name indicates, data stored in ROM may only be read.

#### Modem 
A modem is something that is connected to a computer to connect it to the internet or other networks. This is typically in the form of a small box that you get from your provider.

#### Hard Disk	
The Hard Disk is where the data is stored within the computer.

#### Database	
A collection of data organized and designed for easy access.

### WEB AND NETWORK

#### Network
The network is two or more connected computer which can share resource like a printer, an internet connection, application, etc. The network provides connectivity between computers and devices within a restricted range.

#### Types of Network
There are three types of networks:

##### LAN (Local Area Network):
> LAN is a network that connects a small number of the system in a relatively close geographical area. E.g., a floor or nearby surrounding of a building.

##### MAN (Metropolitan area Network):
> It is a communication infrastructure that has been developed in and around large cities.

##### WAN (Wide Area Network:
> It is a network that connects two or more local-area networks over a large geographic distance. A WAN spans across a large geographic area, such as a state, province or country.

#### Internet
The internet is a collection of interconnected devices which are spread across the globe. It is a network of networks that consist of public, private, public, sales, finance, academic, business and government networks.

### Software Development

#### Software Development
Software development is the collective processes involved in creating software programs, embodying all the stages throughout the systems development life cycle (SDLC).

#### Software Development Lifecycle
SDLC methodologies support the design of software to meet a business need, the development of software to meet the specified design and the deployment of software to production and maintennance. There are a total of 7 steps in the SDLC lifecyle.The main focus of this SDLC phase is to ensure that needs continue to be met and that the system continues to perform as per the specifications mentioned by the client.

##### Requirement collection and analysis
> Requirements Gathering stage need teams to get detailed and precise requirements. This helps companies to finalize the necessary timeline to finish the work of that system.

##### Feasibility study
> Once the requirement analysis phase is completed the next step is to define and document software needs. This process conducted with the help of 'Software Requirement Specification' document also known as 'SRS' document which states all requirements with clear details.

##### Software Design
> The system and software design documents are prepared as per the requirement specification document. This helps define overall system architecture.

##### Programming
> In this phase, developers start build the entire system by writing code using the chosen programming language. In the coding phase, tasks are divided into units or modules and assigned to the various developers.

##### Testing
> Once the software is complete, and it is deployed in the testing environment. The testing team starts testing the functionality of the entire system. 

##### Installation/Deployment
Once the software testing phase is over and no bugs or errors left in the system then the final deployment process starts.

##### Maintenance
> Once the system is deployed, and customers start using the developed system, following 3 activities occur i.e bug fixing, upgrade and enhacements.
 
### Web Development

#### Web Development
Web development refers to building, creating, and an maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. Let us study all these terms in detail.

#### How do websites work?
All websites, at their most basic, are just a bunch of files that are stored on a computer called a server. This server is connected to the internet. You can then load that website through a browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) on your computer or your phone. Your browser is also called the client in this situation.
So, every time that you’re on the internet, you (the client) are getting and loading data (like cat pics) from the server, as well as submitting data back to the server (load moar cat pics!) This back and forth between the client and the server is the basis of the internet.

#### Web Designer
A web designer is someone who is both creative and technically inclined, and uses both these attributes to build or redesign websites. The web designer has the ability to understand what is needed to make a website functional and easy to use, but at the same time make it aesthetically appealing to the user.

#### Web Developer
A web developer is one that develops applications and functionality for the Internet.

#### Code editor
When you build a website, the most essential tool that you will use is your code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment). This tool allows you to write the markup and code that will make up the website. For example when you want to write code in html, you use Visual Studio, so Visual Studio is an example of code editor.

#### Basic front-end
The front-end of a website is made up of three types of files: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These files are what is loaded in the browser, on the client side.

##### HTML
> HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of all websites. It’s the main file type that is loaded in your browser when you look at a website. The HTML file contains all the content on the page, and it uses tags to denote different types of content.

##### CSS
> CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, lets you style that HTML content so it looks nice and fancy. You can add colors, custom fonts, and layout the elements of your website.

##### Javascript 
> JavaScript is a programming language that was designed to run in the browser. Using JavaScript, you can make your website dynamic, meaning it will respond to different inputs from the user, or other sources.

#### Tools
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the basic building blocks of front-end web development. In addition to them, there are a few other tools that will help you build websites easily.

##### Package Managers
> Package managers are online collections of software, much of it open source. Each piece of software, called a package, is available for you to install and use in your own projects.
You can think about them like plugins– instead of writing everything from scratch, you can use helpful utilities that other people have written already.

#### Version control
Version control (also called source control) is a system that keeps track of every code change that you make in your project files. You can even revert to a previous change if you make a mistake. It’s almost like having infinite save points for your project, and let me tell you, it can be a huge lifesaver.

##### Git
> The most popular version control system is an open source system called Git. Using Git, you can store all your files and their change history in collections called repositories.

#### Basic back-end
The back-end, or server-side of web development, is made up of three main components: the server, a server-side programming language, and the database.

#### Server
The server is the computer where all the website files, the database, and other components are stored.

#### Programming language
On the server, you need to use a programming language to write the functions and logic for your application. The server then compiles your code and conveys the result back to the client. There are many programming languages such as C#, Node js and PHP etc.

#### Database
Database is where you store information for your website. It is simply an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.
