#### Computer
A computer is a device that executes a program or programs. 

#### Hardware:
Hardware consists of the physical components of your computer. If you can kick it, punch it, or pick it up to throw it, it’s hardware. For e.g. Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor are hardware

#### Software	
A software is a program application; which provides the computer with step-by-step instructions to perform a specific task. A computer cannot function without software.

#### Application Program
A Program that has been created to perform a specific task that is useful to the user. Examples include Word Processors (Word), Spreadsheets (Excel), Browsers (Netscape) and Drawing Packages (Paint).

#### CPU 
The central processing unit or CPU, also known as the microprocessor or processor. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions

#### Operating System  
The operating system (OS) of a computer is the software that communicates with the computer hardware. No software can run on the computer without the operating system.

#### File 
A file is a block of information that includes word documents, pictures, music, etc. Each file is differentiated with the help of a unique file name. 

#### Folder 
A folder is a system that helps in organizing files, programs and projects on the computer. It is similar to organizing files on a shelf in your cabinet. 

#### Memory	
Chips that hold information that the computer needs to use. These chips are connected directly to the Microprocessor. There are two types of Memory Chip:-
Random Access Memory (RAM)
Read Only Media (ROM)

#### RAM
RAM (random access memory) is the memory of a computer which works actively with the hard drive. It pulls the data when it’s in use then returns it back to the hard drive once you’re done with it.

#### ROM
ROM is a storage medium that is used with computers and other electronic devices. As the name indicates, data stored in ROM may only be read.

#### Modem 
A modem is something that is connected to a computer to connect it to the internet or other networks. This is typically in the form of a small box that you get from your provider.

#### Hard Disk	
The Hard Disk is where the data is stored within the computer.

#### Database	
A collection of data organized and designed for easy access.


#### Network
The network is two or more connected computer which can share resource like a printer, an internet connection, application, etc. The network provides connectivity between computers and devices within a restricted range.

#### Types of Network
There are three types of networks:

##### LAN (Local Area Network):
> LAN is a network that connects a small number of the system in a relatively close geographical area. E.g., a floor or nearby surrounding of a building.

##### MAN (Metropolitan area Network):
> It is a communication infrastructure that has been developed in and around large cities.

##### WAN (Wide Area Network:
> It is a network that connects two or more local-area networks over a large geographic distance. A WAN spans across a large geographic area, such as a state, province or country.

#### Internet
The internet is a collection of interconnected devices which are spread across the globe. It is a network of networks that consist of public, private, public, sales, finance, academic, business and government networks.

#### Software Development
Software development is the collective processes involved in creating software programs, embodying all the stages throughout the systems development life cycle (SDLC).

#### Software Development Lifecycle
SDLC methodologies support the design of software to meet a business need, the development of software to meet the specified design and the deployment of software to production and maintennance. There are a total of 7 steps in the SDLC lifecyle.The main focus of this SDLC phase is to ensure that needs continue to be met and that the system continues to perform as per the specifications mentioned by the client.

##### Requirement collection and analysis
Requirements Gathering stage need teams to get detailed and precise requirements. This helps companies to finalize the necessary timeline to finish the work of that system.

##### Feasibility study
Once the requirement analysis phase is completed the next step is to define and document software needs. This process conducted with the help of 'Software Requirement Specification' document also known as 'SRS' document which states all requirements with clear details.

##### Software Design
The system and software design documents are prepared as per the requirement specification document. This helps define overall system architecture.

##### Programming
In this phase, developers start build the entire system by writing code using the chosen programming language. In the coding phase, tasks are divided into units or modules and assigned to the various developers.

##### Testing
Once the software is complete, and it is deployed in the testing environment. The testing team starts testing the functionality of the entire system. 

##### Installation/Deployment

##### Maintenance
Once the system is deployed, and customers start using the developed system, following 3 activities occur i.e bug fixing, upgrade and enhacements.
